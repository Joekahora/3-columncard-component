## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS preprocessor SASS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What i learned

- To Use Flexbox efficently
- Changing the display property to block for each section to stack on top of each other i.e
 ```css
    .container{
        margin: 2rem auto;
        max-width: 300px;
        display: block;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
    }
 ```

 ### Continued development

I'll continue focusing on learning to use flexbox efficently and also try to understand the difference between justify-content and align-content properties in css.
